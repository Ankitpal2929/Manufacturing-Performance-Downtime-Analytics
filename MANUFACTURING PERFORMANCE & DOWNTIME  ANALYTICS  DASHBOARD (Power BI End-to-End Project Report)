Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design an industry-grade Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of manufacturing performance, line efficiency, and downtime. The dashboard enables management to identify efficiency gaps, operator performance issues, and key downtime drivers for informed decision-making.

Data Sources & Understanding
The project uses multiple manufacturing datasets, including:
•	Line Productivity data (Production Time, Net Production Time, Operator)
•	Line Downtime data (Downtime Minutes, Downtime Factors, Batch)
•	Product Master data
•	Downtime Factor reference data
These datasets represent real-world manufacturing KPIs commonly used in production analytics.

Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)
Power Query Editor was used extensively to prepare the data:
•	Removed null values, duplicates, and inconsistent records
•	Corrected data types (numeric, text, time-based fields)
•	Standardized column names for clarity and modeling
•	Created aggregated views using Group By (Operator-wise Production & Downtime)
•	Applied Append Queries to combine multi-period datasets
•	Performed Merge Queries (Joins) between:
o	Line Productivity ↔ Products
o	Line Productivity ↔ Line Downtime
o	Line Downtime ↔ Downtime Factors
This ensured clean, structured, and analysis-ready data.

Data Modeling
A clean star-schema model was designed:
•	Fact Tables: Line Productivity, Line Downtime
•	Dimension Tables: Operators, Products, Downtime Factors
Proper relationships and cardinality were defined to enable accurate cross-filtering and optimal performance.

DAX Measures & Calculations
Key business metrics were created using DAX:
•	Total Production Time
•	Total Downtime
•	Net Production Time
•	Overall Line Efficiency (%)
•	Target Efficiency comparison
•	Funnel stage values using DATATABLE
These measures power all KPIs and advanced visuals.

Dashboard Structure & Visual Design
The report is divided into three professional pages:
1. Executive Summary
•	KPI Cards (Production Time, Efficiency %, Downtime)
•	Efficiency vs Target Gauge
•	Funnel Chart (Planned → Production → Downtime → Net Production)
•	Advanced clustered column chart for efficiency vs downtime
•	Executive insight text panel for management interpretation
2. Operator Performance
•	Operator-wise efficiency comparison
•	Trend analysis by operator
•	Scatter chart: Efficiency vs Downtime
•	Interactive slicers for operators
3. Downtime Analysis
•	Downtime factor distribution (Donut chart)
•	Batch-level downtime impact
•	Product-wise downtime comparison
•	Root-cause focused visuals

Advanced Features Used
•	Interactive slicers and filters
•	Navigation buttons
•	Custom tooltips
•	Conditional formatting
•	Insight panels for business interpretation
•	Professional layout, spacing, and theming
